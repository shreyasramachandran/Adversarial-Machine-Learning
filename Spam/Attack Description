In a good word attack, one of the most common techniques, a spammer modifies a spam message by inserting or appending words indicative of legitimate email.

To perform the attack on this model, I have used a training data which the model was predicting as spam and changed some words and the end result was that the model was finally predicting it as non-spam even though the original intent was conveyed.

The original email : 

Subject: unbelievable new homes made easy  im wanting to show you this  homeowner  you have been pre - approved for a $ 454 , 169 home loan at a 3 . 72 fixed rate .  this offer is being extended to you unconditionally and your credit is in no way a factor .  to take advantage of this limited time opportunity  all we ask is that you visit our website and complete  the 1 minute post approval form  look foward to hearing from you ,  dorcas pittman 

The modified one :

Subject: New homes are out there for you, and you have been approved for a loan at a 3.72 rate all you have to do is take this advantage and follow the instructions given here ,  Vince Kaminski

Here Vince Kaminski on analysis was found to be a word of high importance in the non-spam emails, and was thus used
